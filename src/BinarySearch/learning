in binary search
1) always use start = mid+1 other wise case like start = 2 and end = 3 will get stuck as mid will always be 2

2)
also in binary search  when while lops end as start = end+1 (start becomes end +1 as we apply while loop as i<=j)
this means the number we are trying to search will be between start and end where end < start. that means start will be
greater then k and end will be less then k


1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10

sreach 8

i = 0;
j  = 5

mid = 2

i = 3
j = 5

mid = 4

i = 5
j = 5

mid = 5

i = 5
j = 4

3)
to find number in biotonic array
1) find max in biotonic array
2) apply binary sarch in both end


4)

use while(i<=j) only if j= mod-1 and i = mid +1
else i/j = mid use while(i<j) because when i == j mid is always = j

5) start = mid + 1 end = mid should use >= for start


another way of to find mid when start and end is very large number

int guess = (start & end) + ((start ^ end) >> 1);

Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,

1 ^ 1 = 0
29 ^ 29 = 0
Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,

1 ^ 0 = 1
31 ^ 0 = 31
XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:

(a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
a ^ b = b ^ a


4 = 1 0 0
6 = 1 1 0
xor = 0 1 0

1 0

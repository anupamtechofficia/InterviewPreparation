by default we don't have way to create index on tags and field



tags is

components in in flux db schema

1. Bucket: Named location where time series data is stored. In the InfluxDB SQL implementation,
a bucket is synonymous with a database. A bucket can contain multiple measurements.

2. measurement - string (example : view)
3. tags : identifier (key value pair)
   example:
   companyId : "abc"
   addId: "xyz"
4. field support datatype like int , long double etc
   count : integer

   recommend :

   home,location=kitchen,sensor_model=A612,sensor_id=1726ZA temp=72.1
   home,location=bath,sensor_model=A612,sensor_id=2635YB temp=71.8
   here location, sensor_model , sensor_id is tag
   temp is field
   home is measurement name


   max total column allowed (tag, filed, measurement ) =  200


   sharding is done using time
   shard 1 - day 1
   shard 2 - day 2
   shard 3 - day 3
